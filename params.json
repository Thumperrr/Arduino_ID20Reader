{"name":"Arduino ID20Reader Library","tagline":"","body":"ID20Reader Arduino Library\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis is a simple, minimalistic library created to simplify the use of the ID12 or ID20 RFID reader for the Arduino.\r\nThe library behaves similarly to the Serial library that comes with the Arduino.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nEmails can be sent to sbhall808(at)hotmail(dot)com with any questions or requests. \r\nYou can also post in the issues on GitHub if you find problems or have general questions.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nSo far this library has only been tested with an Arduino Uno (rev 3.) If you have success with other versions of the arduino, I would very much like to know about it!\r\n\r\n## Download and Installation\r\n[Download the library by clicking here](https://github.com/Thumperrr/Arduino_ID20Reader/archive/master.zip).\r\nUnzip the library to any location.\r\nMove the ID20Reader folder into your Arduino Libraries directory. \r\nBegin coding.\r\n\r\n## Example code\r\n```C++\r\n#include <ID20Reader.h>\r\n\r\nint rx_pin = 9; //Data input pin\r\nint tx_pin = 8; //Unused, but must be defined. (Nothing is sent from the Arduino to the reader.)\r\n\r\nID20Reader rfid(rx_pin, tx_pin); //Create an instance of ID20Reader.\r\n\r\nvoid setup() {\r\n  Serial.begin(9600);\r\n  Serial.println(\"RFID Reader - Swipe a card ~~~~~\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid loop() {\r\n  rfid.read(); //Receive a tag from the reader if available\r\n  \r\n  if(rfid.available()) //a tag has been read\r\n  {\r\n    String code = rfid.get(); //Get the tag\r\n    Serial.println(code); //Print the tag to the serial monitor\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
