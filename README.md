ID20Reader Arduino Library
==========================

## Description
This is a simple, minimalistic library created to simplify the use of the ID12 or ID20 RFID reader for the Arduino.
The library behaves similarly to the Serial library that comes with the Arduino.

## Contact
Emails can be sent to sbhall808(at)hotmail(dot)com with any questions or requests. 
You can also post in the issues on GitHub if you find problems or have general questions.

## Testing
So far this library has only been tested with an Arduino Uno (rev 3.) If you have success with other versions of the arduino, I would very much like to know about it!
